# Artfolio

This is a personal project to implement a portfolio for artists. As you can see it's still on construction, so follow ahead to see the final result.

By now it uses Swiper and MaterialUI as libraries.

To make it run:

1. Copy de repository on your device
2. npm install
3. npm start

Hope you like it!
